### Syntax Extensions ###

Syntax extensions are more for ease-of-use than something that must be used. It's pretty easy to write these extensions yourself. The following extensions have been created to save you even more time.

- [Exceptions](docs/glossary/syntax-extensions/exceptions.md)
- [Regex](docs/glossary/syntax-extensions/regex.md)
- [Option](docs/glossary/syntax-extensions/option.md)
- [Either](docs/glossary/syntax-extensions/either.md)
- [Try](docs/glossary/syntax-extensions/try.md)
- [null](docs/glossary/syntax-extensions/null.md)
